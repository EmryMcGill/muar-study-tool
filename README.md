# Study tool for MUAR 211 (Art of Listening)
## Author: Emry Mcgill

## Description:
This is a study tool web app I made to help me study for the Art of Listening class. I found it hard to study the songs effectivly because when I skip to the next song in the playlist it always starts at the beginning. So I end up learning the beginning of the songs well, but in the exams the song starts at a random point. So with this tool, I can start the song in a random place to learn all parts of the songs better.
